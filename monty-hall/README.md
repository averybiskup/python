The Monty Hall problem is from a game show where there
are three doors: 2 with goats (or something bad), and 1
with a car.
First: the player chooses one door
Second: the player is shown one of the doors with a goat in it
Third: the player is asked weather he/she wants to switch their choice
Fourth: whichever door the player ends with, he/she gets that prize

The problem:
Is it best to switch your choice or keep with your door.

Solution:
If you don't switch, you have 33% of getting the car

If you do switch you have 66% of getting the car,
because you have seen 2 doors

ALWAYS SWITCH

This program tests this theory with a brute force method
