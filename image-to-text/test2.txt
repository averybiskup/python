''" Uses a function to compute the new balance of a
specified investment with 5% interest after a period
of 10 years. Then uses the same function to show the
new balance of the same initial investment at other
interest rates and time periods

def accrue_interest(cur_balance, rate, years):

Returns the new balance when cur_balance is invested for

specified number of years at specified interest rate.

for elapsed_years in range(years):  # For specified number of years..
cur_balance += cur_balance * rate # Add interest to the balance

return cur_balance
# Beginning of main part of program
init_balance = float(input("Please enter initial balance: $"))

# Compile interest for 10 years at 5%
new_balance = accrue_interest(init_balance, 0.05, 10)

# Output the result

print("After 10 years at 5%, your balance will be: $", format(new_balance, '.2f')

# Compile interest for 10 years at 1%
new_balance = accrue_interest(init_balance, 0.01, 10)
print("After 10 years at 1%, your balance will be: $", format(new_balance, '.2f')

# Output the result of compiling interest for 7 years at 1%
print("After 7 years at 1%, your balance will be: $",
format (accrue_interest(init_balance, 0.01, 7), '.2f'))

# Sample Output:

Please enter initial balance: $ 100

After 10 years at 5%, your balance will be: $ 162.89
After 10 years at 1%, your balance will be: $ 110.46
After 7 years at 1%, your balance will be: $ 107.21

Please enter initial balance: $ 975.50

After 10 years at 5%, your balance will be: $ 1588.99
After 10 years at 1%, your balance will be: $ 1077.56
After 7 years at 1%, your balance will be: $ 1045.87
