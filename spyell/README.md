## New Python web crawler idea  
  
given a link crawl the website and its internal links to find spelling errors  
and report back where on the website, maybe even the tag that the word was in  
so the user can fix that error.  
  
the important part is that it goes through the entire website following links  
so it can find all the spelling errors.  
  
this is just a simple terminal app that devs can use to check their sites for
bugs  

TODO:  
[ ] collect text from paragraph tags  
[ ] decide on what other tags to collect and implement  
[ ] start on output that shows tags and maybe links somehow?
