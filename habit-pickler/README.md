The idea for this project is to solidify habits.  
  
Pickling is the process of turning something raw, that can't  
last long on it's own, to something that can last without external help.  
  
Much like pickling, forming habits takes time, and effort.  
  
Hence, habit-pickler.  
  
I give credit to this idea to the library I will be using: pickle.
